# FSTT-Chatbot

This repository contains the code and resources for the FSTT Chatbot project, an intelligent academic chatbot developed specifically for the Faculty of Science and Technology of Tangier (FSTT). The chatbot leverages advanced AI technologies, including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuned language models, to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses to students' and instructors' inquiries.

## Team

The FSTT Chatbot project is built by the team consisting of:

- Marouan Daghmoumi
- Mohammed Aachabi
- Adnane Riyadi
- Yasmina Hachhouch

The project is supervised and guided by Professor Lotfi El Aachak.

## Repositories

The project is organized into three main repositories:

### 1. [chatbot_Data](https://github.com/FSTT-chatbot/chatbot_Data)

This repository contains the code and data for the FSTT Chatbot project. The project involves web scraping, data preprocessing, and fine-tuning a chatbot model to answer questions related to the FSTT.

### 2. [chatbot_Backend](https://github.com/FSTT-chatbot/chatbot_Backend)

This is the backend part of the chatbot application. It serves the fine-tuned language model and RAG model for real-time inference, leveraging technologies like Flask, Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, and ChromaDB.

### 3. [chatbot_Frontend](https://github.com/FSTT-chatbot/chatbot_Frontend)

This repository contains the frontend part of the chatbot application, built with Vue.js and Tailwind CSS. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the chatbot in real-time.
